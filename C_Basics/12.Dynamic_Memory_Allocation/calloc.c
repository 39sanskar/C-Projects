/*
1. Initialization: calloc initializes all allocated memory to zero.
2. Syntax: Takes two arguments, the number of elements and the size of each
element.
3. Usage: Preferred for array allocation when zero-initialization is needed.
4. Memory Overhead: May have slightly more overhead than malloc due to
initialization.
5. Return Type: Like malloc, returns a void* pointer that should be cast to the
appropriate type.

/*
Concept:

calloc, which does zero-initialize the allocated memory. That means all elements of arr 
should be initialized to 0 before you input any values into them.
 
However, you are immediately taking user input and overwriting those values, 
which is why you donâ€™t see the zero initialization.
