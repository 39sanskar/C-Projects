/*
1. Matrix of Characters: In a 2D array of characters each row represents a string.
2. String Array: Often used to store multiple strings of the same maximum length.
3. Null Termination: Each string in the array must end with a null character '\0â€™.
4. Fixed Width: All strings have a fixed maximum width, defined by the column size of the 2D array.
5. Row Access: Access a specific string (row) with single indexing, 
e.g., charArray[0] accesses the first string.
6. Character Access: Access individual characters with double indexing, e.g., charArray[1][2] 
accesses the 3rd character of the 2nd string.
7. Initialization: Can be initialized row by row using string literals,
e.g., char charArray[3][4] = {"abc", "def", "ghi"};.
