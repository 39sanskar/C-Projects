âœ… printf("Address of i = %p\n", &i);
&i is the memory address of the variable i.
This prints the location in memory where i is stored.
ðŸ§  Output example: Address of i = 0x7ffee9f5b67c

âœ… printf("Address of i = %p\n", j);
j stores the address of i, i.e., j == &i.
So this prints the same address as the line above.
ðŸ§  Output: Same as previous line.

âœ… printf("Address of j = %p\n", &j);
&j is the address of the pointer variable j itself.
This is a different memory location than i.
ðŸ§  Output example: Address of j = 0x7ffee9f5b670

âœ… printf("Value of j = %p\n", j);
Again, j stores the address of i, so this is the same as printing &i.
ðŸ§  Output: Same as line 1 and 2.

âœ… printf("Value of i = %d\n", i);
Prints the value of i, which is simply 3.
ðŸ§  Output: Value of i = 3

âœ… printf("Value of i = %d\n", *(&i));
&i gets the address of i.
*(&i) dereferences it, giving the value stored at that address, which is again 3.
ðŸ§  Output: Value of i = 3

âœ… printf("Value of i = %d\n", *j);
j points to i, so *j gets the value stored at the address j holds â†’ which is the value of i.
ðŸ§  Output: Value of i = 3

Summary:

| Expression      | Meaning                        | Output Example               |
| --------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| `&i`            | Address of `i`                 | `0x7ffee9f5b67c`             |
| `j`             | Holds the address of `i`       | `0x7ffee9f5b67c`             |
| `&j`            | Address of pointer `j`         | `0x7ffee9f5b670` (different) |
| `*j` or `*(&i)` | Value stored at address of `i` | `3`                          |
| `i`             | The integer value              | `3`                          |
